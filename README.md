# Every Human Should Know 🤓
As the [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(fictional))📒  attempts to be "the standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom". Here, we want to try to create a list of several different topics to improve our overall life. 

I started this list because is very difficult to find good stuff about different aspects of life through the internet noise. Here you will only find non-technical stuff! Things like how to cook better, health, crafting, DIY, learning, and so on! 

This is inspired by [Every Programmer Should Know](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know).
